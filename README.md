# Minecraft Addon Generator
Template NodeJS+Fastify site to generate Minecraft Bedrock Edition addons with content edited per user based on their input. There is currently no documentation but it should be pretty easy to understand with a basic knowledge of NodeJS and Fastify

There is also a PHP version in the [php-version branch](https://github.com/McMelonTV/mcpack-generator/tree/php-version)

Demo: Soon
